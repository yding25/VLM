current_state_prompt: |
  You are controlling a robotic arm. Your task is to analyze the status of the items in the current picture one by one:

  Now there are these items in the picture:
  {obj_list}

  Analyze the status of the items as in the following example:
  door is OPEN, clothespile is CLOSED, coffeemaker is OFF, microwave is OFF and CLOSED, lightswitch is ON, kitchencabinet is CLOSED, fridge is CLOSED, faucet is OFF, tv is OFF, kitchencounter is CLOSED, coffeepot is CLOSED, green square is ON the red square, plate is ON the table, apple is ON the plate, fork is IN the cap, avocado is NEXT TO the cap, plate is IN the microwave

  As the example's format, you should output the status of all objects. The description should be as detailed as possible, including the condition of the items and the spatial relationships between them.

obj_prompt: |
  please find all items in the picture, and give me a list of items. Your answers will be used directly as search terms, so I only need a list of item names. For example:["Oven", "Microwave", "Water Boiler", "Paper Towel Roll"] 



dis_prompt: |
  Please describe all objects in the image along with their states and positions. 
  The image is encoded in base64 format: {base64_image}
  First you need to list what objects are included in the image. Then describe the state and spatial relationship of the object

  Analyze the status of the items as in the following example:
  door is OPEN, clothespile is CLOSED, coffeemaker is OFF, microwave is OFF and CLOSED, lightswitch is ON, kitchencabinet is CLOSED, fridge is CLOSED, faucet is OFF, tv is OFF, kitchencounter is CLOSED, coffeepot is CLOSED, green square is ON the red square, plate is ON the table, apple is ON the plate, fork is IN the cap, avocado is NEXT TO the cap, plate is IN the microwave

keys_prompt: |
  You are a human assistant. The user has now proposed a goal. Please analyze the objects that appear in the goal. Since your answer will be used directly in the query, your reply can only be a list containing all items 
  Goal: {goal}
  For example:
  goal: Put the apple on the plate
  ['apple', 'plate']

  You are controlling a robotic arm. Your task is to complete the following goal:

  Goal: {goal}

  The current state of the environment can be observed in the following image:
  {base64_image}

  Before planning steps, review past records related to this goal:
  {records}
  Please check all records carefully, especially failure cases and user instructions, and get improvement suggestions from user instructions to avoid the same error this time.

  Here are the actions you can use to achieve the goal:
  - turnright: Turn the robotic arm to the right
  - turnleft: Turn the robotic arm to the left
  - walkforward: Move the robotic arm forward
  - walktowards <obj>: Move the robotic arm towards the specified object
  - walk <obj>: Walk to the specified object
  - run <obj>: Run to the specified object
  - grab <obj>: Grab the specified object
  - switchon <obj>: Turn on the specified object
  - switchoff <obj>: Turn off the specified object
  - open <obj>: Open the specified object
  - close <obj>: Close the specified object
  - lookat <obj>: Look at the specified object
  - sit <obj>: Sit at the specified object
  - standup: Stand up
  - find <obj>: Find the specified object
  - turnto <obj>: Turn to the specified object
  - drink <obj>: Drink from the specified object
  - pointat <obj>: Point at the specified object
  - watch <obj>: Watch the specified object
  - putin <obj> <obj>: Put the first specified object into the second specified object                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
  - putback <obj> <obj>: Put the first specified object back into the second specified object
  - done: Indicate that the task is completed

  Based on the current state and the available actions, please provide a step-by-step action plan to achieve the goal. 

  Please ensure that your action plan only includes actions from the list provided above, and each step should be clearly stated in the format below:
  [action] ("object1", (optional: "object2"))
  [action] ("object1", (optional: "object2"))
 
  Example plan of Put the fork into the cup:
  def Put_the_fork_into_the_cup(): find ("fork") walktowards ("fork") grab ("fork") find ("cup") putin ("fork","cup") done



correction_prompt: |
  You are controlling a robotic arm. Just now you proposed the motion planning of the robotic arm according to the requirements, but the user needs to make instructions on this. You need to extract keywords from the instructions provided by users.:
  The current plan step is as follows: {planstep}. 
  The user has provided the following instructions: {instructions}.

  you need save the data as .json, and save all keys as follow: "items","color","state of items","failure case","user instructions"

  Items should contain all objects mentioned in the picture and user instructions. Color needs to list the colors of all items and the saved format should be like: item(color). State of items should include the working status of all items and the spatial relationship between them. Failure case is the current plan step shown above. Summarize user instructions into one sentence and fill it in user instructions.
  
  Analyze the status of the items as in the following example:
  door is OPEN, clothespile is CLOSED, coffeemaker is OFF, microwave is OFF and CLOSED, lightswitch is ON, kitchencabinet is CLOSED, fridge is CLOSED, faucet is OFF, tv is OFF, kitchencounter is CLOSED, coffeepot is CLOSED, green square is ON the red square, plate is ON the table, apple is ON the plate, fork is IN the cap, avocado is NEXT TO the cap, plate is IN the microwave

  Your reply will be saved directly as a json file, so I only need you to reply to the subject part of the json.
