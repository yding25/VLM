current_state_prompt: |
  You are controlling a robotic arm. Your task is to analyze the status of the items in the current picture one by one:

  Now there are these items in the picture:
  {obj_list}

  Analyze the status of the items as in the following example:
  door is OPEN, clothespile is CLOSED, coffeemaker is OFF, microwave is OFF and CLOSED, lightswitch is ON, kitchencabinet is CLOSED, fridge is CLOSED, faucet is OFF, tv is OFF, kitchencounter is CLOSED, coffeepot is CLOSED, green square is ON the red square, plate is ON the table, apple is ON the plate, fork is IN the cap, avocado is NEXT TO the cap, plate is IN the microwave

  As the example's format, you should output the status of all objects. The description should be as detailed as possible, including the condition of the items and the spatial relationships between them.

  You are controlling a robotic arm. Your task is to complete the following goal:

  Goal: {goal}

  The current state of the environment can be observed in the following image:
  {base64_image}

  Here are the actions you can use to achieve the goal:
  - turnright: Turn the robotic arm to the right
  - turnleft: Turn the robotic arm to the left
  - walkforward: Move the robotic arm forward
  - walktowards <obj>: Move the robotic arm towards the specified object
  - walk <obj>: Walk to the specified object
  - run <obj>: Run to the specified object
  - grab <obj>: Grab the specified object
  - switchon <obj>: Turn on the specified object
  - switchoff <obj>: Turn off the specified object
  - open <obj>: Open the specified object
  - close <obj>: Close the specified object
  - lookat <obj>: Look at the specified object
  - sit <obj>: Sit at the specified object
  - standup: Stand up
  - find <obj>: Find the specified object
  - turnto <obj>: Turn to the specified object
  - drink <obj>: Drink from the specified object
  - pointat <obj>: Point at the specified object
  - watch <obj>: Watch the specified object
  - putin <obj> <obj>: Put the first specified object into the second specified object
  - putback <obj> <obj>: Put the first specified object back into the second specified object
  - done: Indicate that the task is completed

  Based on the current state and the available actions, please provide a step-by-step action plan to achieve the goal. 

  Please ensure that your action plan only includes actions from the list provided above, and each step should be clearly stated in the format below:
  [action] ("object1", (optional: "object2"))
  [action] ("object1", (optional: "object2"))
  ...

  Example plan: Put the fork into the cup
  def Put_the_fork_into_the_cup():
    find ("fork")
    walktowards ("fork")
    grab ("fork")
    find ("cup")
    putin ("fork","cup")
    done

  As the example's format, you should output like a python function, and each step of action is the function content.
